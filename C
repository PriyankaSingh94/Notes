=> C developed at AT and T's bell labs by Dennis Ritchie.
=>It replaced old langs like ALGOL(Algorithm Language, an imperative progm lang) and FORTRAN(Formula transition).
=>It was preferred to newer langs like PASCAl(imperative and procedural prog lanmg) and APL(A programming lang).
=>If a variable is not initialized then it will contain garbage value.
=> a > b ? g = a : g = b ; will give error lvalue required as left operand of assignment. The copiler will think as b is being assigned to
  the expression in left side. This can be overcome by a > b ? g = a : (g = b);
=> 3 == 3.0 will evaluate to true.  
=> Strings should be inside double quotes.
=> If multiple expressions and assignment are present in printf for the same variable then evaluation will be from right to left.
=>Ternary condition does not allow ; in middle of the expression like
            ( n == 9 ? printf( "You are correct" ) ; : printf( "You are wrong" ) ;) ;
=>For loop can have multiple initialization andincrementation. like for ( i = 1, j = 2 ; j <= 10 ; j++ ). It must be comma seperated.
  However only one expression is allowed. Multiple initialization is comma seperated and tha is why semicolon is used to seperate 3 exprsn.
=>In Odd loop we do not know from before that how many times loop will be executed like running loop until user 
  presses N.
=>In float x = 1.1 ; while ( x == 1.1 ) snippet x is initialized to float but 1.1 in while is of type double which can take a range of values
  so while wont execute.
=>Simplest logic to get individual digits of a number is
        digit1 = number - ((number / 10) * 10);
        digit2 = (number / 10) - ((number / 100) * 10);
        digit3 = (number / 100) - ((number / 1000) * 10);
=> Simplest way to create below pyramid is to use factorials.
      1
    1  1
   1  2  1
  1  3   3  1
1   4  6  4   1

for (int d = 0; d <= i; d++) {    // display loop variable
          num=(Fact(i)/(Fact(d)*Fact(i-d)));  // i stands for row number
            printf("%d",num);
            printf("  ");    
        }
        
=> Switch cases:
  1. Cases can be written in any order.
  2. Char can be used in cases that would be converted to ASCII values
  3. Even there are multiple statements in each case no need to eclose it with  curly braces.
  4. If any statement inside switch does not come under any case then it will not get executed and will not report any error also.
  5. Expression (relational operations or variable expressions) or float cannot be written in case(Disadvantage of switch).Because performing 
      exactly equality with float and double is bad idea.
  6. Expression can be evaluated in switch braces.
  7. Break takes the control out of the switch, however continue will not take control to the beginning of the switch.
  8. Multiple cases cannot use same expressions.
  9. Switch is fast bcuz at the compile time a jump tabke is created but compiler so that no need to check each case at run time.
  10. For lesses cases switch will be slower than if else.
  11. Switch is useful for menu driven programs.
=> Goto: 
    On using goto we can never be sure that how we got to that point. Gotos obscure the flow of control.
    Any number of gotos can take control to same label
    The only programming situation in favour of goto is when we need to take control outside the loop  which is nested inside a number of 
    loops.

=> Functions and Pointers: 
    A function is a self-contained block of statements that perform coherent task of some kind.
    Main function also can be called inside any other function
    A function cannot be defined in any other function.
    return; statement will return a garbage value to the callng fn.
    A function can return one value at a time.
    Calling convention refers to the order in which arguments are passed. In C it is right to left.
      printf ( "%d %d %d", a, ++a, a++ ) ; // will give 3 3 1
    Whenever we call a library function we must write their prototype before making call to know arguments and return types. But on using 
    library function we may not know the prototype so we add some .h files that provides prototypes.
    Any function returns int by default.
=> Pointers: 
    & is used as C's addressOf operator.
    * is used as value at the address operator also called as indirection operator.
    pointers are declared as int *j.(It means value at address is int type)
    On using call by reference we can make one function return more than one values at a time
    Memory for a function is allocated on stack space of the of the process and it is a runtime activity.The stack is last in first out
    data structure.
    Different ways of organizing data are known as data structures.
    The Compiler uses stack data structure for implementing normal as well as recursive function calls.
    tlib.exe (Turbo librarian) utility is used to add user defined function to library for C/C++ turbo compilers.
    C:\>tlib math.lib + c:\fact.obj  // this command will add factorial function to library, can be used by  including #include "c:\\fact.h".
