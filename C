=> C developed at AT and T's bell labs by Dennis Ritchie.
=>It replaced old langs like ALGOL(Algorithm Language, an imperative progm lang) and FORTRAN(Formula transition).
=>It was preferred to newer langs like PASCAl(imperative and procedural prog lanmg) and APL(A programming lang).
=>If a variable is not initialized then it will contain garbage value.
=> a > b ? g = a : g = b ; will give error lvalue required as left operand of assignment. The copiler will think as b is being assigned to
  the expression in left side. This can be overcome by a > b ? g = a : (g = b);
=> 3 == 3.0 will evaluate to true.  
=> Strings should be inside double quotes.
=> If multiple expressions and assignment are present in printf for the same variable then evaluation will be from right to left.
=>Ternary condition does not allow ; in middle of the expression like
            ( n == 9 ? printf( "You are correct" ) ; : printf( "You are wrong" ) ;) ;
