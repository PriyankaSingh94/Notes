=> C developed at AT and T's bell labs by Dennis Ritchie.
=>It replaced old langs like ALGOL(Algorithm Language, an imperative progm lang) and FORTRAN(Formula transition).
=>It was preferred to newer langs like PASCAl(imperative and procedural prog lanmg) and APL(A programming lang).
=>If a variable is not initialized then it will contain garbage value.
=> a > b ? g = a : g = b ; will give error lvalue required as left operand of assignment. The copiler will think as b is being assigned to
  the expression in left side. This can be overcome by a > b ? g = a : (g = b);
=> 3 == 3.0 will evaluate to true.  
=> Strings should be inside double quotes.
=> If multiple expressions and assignment are present in printf for the same variable then evaluation will be from right to left.
=>Ternary condition does not allow ; in middle of the expression like
            ( n == 9 ? printf( "You are correct" ) ; : printf( "You are wrong" ) ;) ;
=>For loop can have multiple initialization andincrementation. like for ( i = 1, j = 2 ; j <= 10 ; j++ ). It must be comma seperated.
  However only one expression is allowed. Multiple initialization is comma seperated and tha is why semicolon is used to seperate 3 exprsn.
=>In Odd loop we do not know from before that how many times loop will be executed like running loop until user 
  presses N.
=>In float x = 1.1 ; while ( x == 1.1 ) snippet x is initialized to float but 1.1 in while is of type double which can take a range of values
  so while wont execute.
=>Simplest logic to get individual digits of a number is
        digit1 = number - ((number / 10) * 10);
        digit2 = (number / 10) - ((number / 100) * 10);
        digit3 = (number / 100) - ((number / 1000) * 10);
