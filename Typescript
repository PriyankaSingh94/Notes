=> Types available in typescript are boolean, number, string, array,tuple, void, null, undefined,enum ,any , never and 
   object. 
=> We can use backtick to create template strings that can span multiple lines and can have embedded expressions.
=> Tuple eg. = let arr: [string, number]
=> Any is used to opt in and optout from typechecking. We can't use object as it will not allow invoking methods even if 
   those methods are present for the variable.
=> Void can only be assigned to null or undefined type.
=> Null, undefined and never are subtype of all data types.
=> No type is assigneble to never.
=> Object represent non primitive datatype.

=> const variable can't be reassigned.
=> let uses lexical scoping or block scoping.
