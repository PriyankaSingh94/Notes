 Sol =>This will have one loop for rows, one for inverted triangle made of spaces and one for values to be displayed
        that will be like

        for (int d = 0; d <= i; d++) {    // display loop variable
              num=(Fact(i)/(Fact(d)*Fact(i-d)));  // i stands for row number
                printf("%d",num);
                printf("  ");    
            }
Note: In this soln the rows loop should run from 0 to less than n.
